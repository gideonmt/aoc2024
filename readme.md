# AoC 2024 solutions

This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024. To run a solution use the `get_input.py` file to copy the input from the AoC website into a file called `DD.in` where `DD` is the day number. Then run the solution file, which reads the input from the file. To use `get_input.py` you need to provide session cookie from the AoC website in a file called `SESSION_COOKIE.txt`.
